# DATA-PROFESSIONAL-SURVEY

A comprehensive survey of data professionals from around the world was conducted by another party and I analysed it in order to gain an understanding of the experiences and perceptions of those in the data industry, and the results are eye-opening.

One key finding is the significant variation in average salary by data job/tech job, with some roles commanding much higher salaries than others. We also found notable differences in average salaries by country, with some regions offering more attractive compensation packages than others.

But it's not all about the money. Our survey also highlighted the challenges that data professionals face in breaking into the industry. 

These findings and more are available in this interactive dashboard, created using Power BI. Take a deep dive into the data and see for yourself the trends and patterns that emerged from this survey. 

Check out my dashboard and share your thoughts on the insights uncovered. #dataprofessionals #breakingintotech #dataanalysis
